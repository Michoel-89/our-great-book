She also liked to shut up!
Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I don't want to be rescued.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. You lived before you met me?! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Ooh, name it after me! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.
Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Also Zoidberg. Can I use the gun? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.
I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Who are those horrible orange men? Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

That's not soon enough! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Who are you, my warranty?! Actually, that's still true.

We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Oh yeah, good luck with that.

These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. But I've never been to the moon!

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Take me to your leader! I don't want to be rescued. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You don't know how to do any of those.

Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. With gusto. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Why not indeed! A true inspiration for the children. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? You don't know how to do any of those. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Your best is an idiot! With gusto. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.
